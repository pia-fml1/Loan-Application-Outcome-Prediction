# Loan-Application-Outcome-Prediction

This repository demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for predicting loan application outcomes. The project involves data analysis, visualization, and model training to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected.

## Overview
1. **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of loan application data to uncover patterns and insights.
2. **Data Visualization**: Visualizations to understand data distributions and relationships between features.
3. **Classification Model Training** : Development and training of a classification model to predict loan application outcomes.
